# FinTech-ML-Training

## Self-Introduction

Hello! My name is _Ian_. I am a Year 2 Computer Science and Statistics student, and my interests as far as ML goes are more towards financial modelling and algorithmic trading.

A fun fact about myself is that I used to drive competitive go-kart in the past _(when I had time lol)_.

Looking forward to meeting you all!

## Other info

I am relatively new to the world of Machine Learning, so I am looking forward to meeting everyone!
