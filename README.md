Self-Introduction Section:
Hello, my name is Ivan. I am a Y1 CS student, and my hobby is watching sad movies and crying myself to sleep.
I have past experience with NLP, and I'm looking towards Algorithmic and Quant trading.
A fun fact about myself is that I am willing to join a cult for marginally better grades. :))
