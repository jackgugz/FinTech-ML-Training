Self-Introduction Section:

Hi, I am Samarth! I am a year 2 Computer Science & Math major.

I am interested in computer vision, especially in video understanding, but am trying
to explore different areas and applications of Machine Learning.

My hobbies are playing football and watching movies.

Fun Fact about me is I sometimes dont have food just because I am lazy to get up.
