# FinTech-ML-Training

Self-Introduction Section:
Hello, I'm Min Rei, a year one computer science and mathematics student. My maching learning interests include systematic investing and algorithmic trading. I hope to learn more about quant research during my time here at NUS FinTech.

My hobbies include beer brewing, climbing, and scuba diving. One fun fact about me is that I once had thirteen teeth extracted at once. No clue why I was born with so many teeth though...
